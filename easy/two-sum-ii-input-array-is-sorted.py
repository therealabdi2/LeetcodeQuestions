'''
Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2,
where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
You may not use the same element twice.



Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
