'''
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.



Example 1:


Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:


Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
